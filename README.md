# 3-bitcounter


## Description

The "3-bitcounter" project implements 3-bit counters using both asynchronous and synchronous methodologies in SystemVerilog. The counters are designed using D flip-flops and T flip-flops.

## Asynchronous Counter

The asynchronous counter is implemented using D flip-flops. It increments asynchronously, changing state on each clock cycle, independent of the clock signal.

## Synchronous Counter

The synchronous counter is implemented using T flip-flops. It increments synchronously, changing state only on the rising edge of the clock signal.

## Folder Structure

- `asynchronous_counter/`: Contains the SystemVerilog files for the asynchronous counter implementation.
- `synchronous_counter/`: Contains the SystemVerilog files for the synchronous counter implementation.
